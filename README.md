## Surrogate Optimization

This notebook is the hands-on part of learning surrogate optimization approach. A walk-through of a case study is given to show how surrogate optimization is employed in practice.

## Companion blog

A separate blog focusing on reviewing the fundamental theories is also available. You can find many illustrations in the blog to facilitate intuitive understanding of the abstract concepts. The blog is located here:
