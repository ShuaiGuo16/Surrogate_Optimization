## Practical Probability Theory (Univariate)

This notebook is the hands-on part of learning practical univariate probability theory and important tools in exploratory data analysis. A walk-through of the code for probability calculations and visualizations are provided.

## Companion blog

A separate blog focusing on reviewing the fundamental theories is also available. You can find many illustrations in the blog to facilitate intuitive understanding of the abstract probability concepts. The blog is located here:
